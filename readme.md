# Themeinabox

This is composition of [spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray), [Seti_ST3](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3) and [Phix Colour Scheme](https://github.com/stuartherbert/sublime-phix-color-scheme). 

## Changes to originals

Spacegray was made more fresh and little bit more colorfull.

I have changed a Phix color scheme a little bit and made it work better with C++ code. Current indent guidelines are now more visible.

Folder icon in tree view is different.
